WooCommerce Multisite module to synchronize product data using the SKU (stock, price...)

== Description ==
WooCommerce Multisite module to synchronize product data using the SKU (stock, price...)

The stock level is automatically synchronized in the selceted "multisite instances".
This is updated across networks when an order is placed.

The same works for price.

Settings: "Multisite-Network > Woo-Sync".

The reason for this plugin is that there are so many bad and complicated plugins out there. 
As a web agency (LEMONTEC), we often need this solution, which we want to share with others.

Future-Version:

* Sync images
* Sync ACF-Fields
